- **WorkflowTransition**: Rules governing movement between states
- **Permission System**: Fine-grained access control for workflow operations

### 1.2 Workflow Definition Model

The `WorkflowDefinition` class (`core/Piranha/Models/WorkflowDefinition.cs`) serves as the foundation of the workflow system:

**Key Properties:**
- **Id**: Unique identifier (GUID)
- **Name**: Human-readable workflow name (max 128 characters)
- **Description**: Detailed workflow description (max 512 characters)
- **ContentTypes**: Comma-separated list of applicable content types
- **IsDefault**: Boolean flag indicating default workflow status
- **IsActive**: Boolean flag for workflow activation state
- **InitialState**: Starting state for new content items
- **States**: Collection of workflow states
- **Transitions**: Collection of permitted state transitions

**Content Type Targeting:**
The workflow system supports targeting specific content types through the `ContentTypes` property, allowing for different approval processes for pages, posts, and custom content types.

### 1.3 Workflow States and Transitions

**State Management:**
Each workflow state contains:
- Key-based identification system
- Display properties (name, color, icon)
- State type flags (published, initial, final)
- Sort ordering for UI presentation

**Transition Control:**
Workflow transitions define:
- Source and target states
- Required permissions for execution
- UI styling options (CSS classes, icons)
- Comment requirements for approval steps
- Notification settings for stakeholders

### 1.4 Content State Tracking

The system tracks content progression through workflow states with the following metadata:
- Current state assignment
- Reviewer identification
